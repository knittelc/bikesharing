# Bikesharing

## Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if a Bike sharing program would perform as well in Des Moine, IA, as has performed in New York City, NY.  Using the bike ride data for NYC in August, several visualizations were put together to answer specific questions around trends using Tableau Public.

## Resources:
- Source Files: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv, 201908-citibike-revised_tripdata.csv
- Software: Tableau, Python 3.7.6, Jupyter NB, Pandas Library

## Results:

The results of the NYC

## Summary:

While this is a great start with data, more is needed for a full analysis.  Looking at some parallels for Des Moine and New York City would be helpful.  How far are the bike starts and stops from each other?  Repeating patterns of weekday usage by user type would be helpful.  It would answer if people are more likely commuting to work, versus tourists using them to get around the city.  Do any of the stop/start locations coordinate with top trouist places?  Does Des Moine also have top tourist areas or a commuting group?  We looked at August, as Des Moine and NYC have winter weather that factors into usage, are these bikes best serviced over the winter and deployed only in the spring, summer, and fall?

Based on the limited data and useful ecplanations with the data visualizations, I would say more data is needed to fully reccomend a Bike share program in Des Moine.  They might be able to run a small pilot program and then compare/contrast the data with some of the trends among user gender, days of the week, and trip duration for both cities.  Des Moine might find that as it is not as large as NYC, the tripduration might be less, but more frequent rentals.
